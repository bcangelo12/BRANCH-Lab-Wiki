# BRANCH-Lab-Wiki

Welcome to the Home page of the BRANCH Lab Wiki! Here you should hopefully find all the relevant information necessary to 
successfully download, store, preprocess, and analyze new imaging data for our current study "BrainChild". As we continue to expand the breadth of our research, this document will be updated alongside new additions to our data collection and analysis pipelines to serve as a centralized location for information and walkthroughs on all relevant pipelines.


This documentation was built using MkDocs, and for more information on how it was built, visit [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org).
